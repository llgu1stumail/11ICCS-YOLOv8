#  # Introduction of the dataset

# 

# The dataset presented in this study is collected from real slabs on the conveyor roller of a continuous casting line in a steel company. To enable comprehensive monitoring of the entire continuous casting slab transportation process, six high-resolution cameras of the same type are strategically installed around the roller table, with each having a fixed shooting angle.

# 

# \#  数据集共有3000张图片，并按照6:2:2的比例划分为train、val、test（因数据量较大，整个train数据集分两次上传，train、train2合起来才是完整的train数据集）
